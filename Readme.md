Off Canvas with css using the pseudo :target selector.
=================================

I was bored yesterday so I played a bit with the :target pseudo selector and came up with this idea for a off canvas effect using only css.

Obviously this is not something you want to use in production, but it was fun.
There are some drawbacks, of course, that I will highlight in an upcoming article.
